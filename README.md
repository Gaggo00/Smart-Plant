# Smart-Plant

## Brief description

Smart Plant is an innovative IoT solution designed to optimize plant irrigation. The solution utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller, runs on the RIOT OS, and integrates with the AWS ecosystem to enhance its functionality.

### Problem
Frequently, the question arises about the best watering frequency for plants. However, having too much information can be tricky, as there's a risk of overwatering or underwatering, which can harm the plant. Striking the right balance becomes crucial, blending irrigation science with careful observation and common sense. The goal is to maintain plant health by steering clear of both excess and water deficiency.
